# 📊 YMCA-Inspired Database Management System (Academic Project)

This is a semester-long academic project developed for my **Database Management Systems** course (CUS1165). The objective was to design and implement a fully relational SQL database inspired by the structure and operations of the New Rochelle YMCA, including its programs, memberships, staff, and donation tracking.
