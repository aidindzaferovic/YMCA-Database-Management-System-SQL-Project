-- -- This query combines participant data with program data to show what kinds of programs are most attended by each age group. This helps in targeted program planning and marketing
-- For example: If Teens (10â€“16) have 100+ sports registrations, that suggests increasing sports staff or sessions. If Adults (17+) have low fitness registrations, the Y might consider promotional discounts or schedule adjustments.
